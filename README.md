# Complementary Computational Drug Discovery Research to FAH project on Oral Non-Covalent SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease Inhibitor Therapeutics

It was performed bioactivity data collection and data preprocess 
of the datasets to validate Molecular Dynamics Simulations from project P13454 of FAH work unit that targets Mpro. Datasets were compiled from efforts to develop non-covalent inhibitors of the main proteases of human coronaviruses e.g. MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-1, resulting in only non-covalent pharmacophores (scaffolds) that have been used to derive molecular series for optimization.
